===============
Blubuntu (beta)
===============

Turns most of Ubuntu color from orange-purple into blue.
Also set new default background picture and cursor color.

This package is not only a theme, it also set up system to use this theme too.

This project has no relation with https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/Blubuntu, since I found they are inactive for too long.
